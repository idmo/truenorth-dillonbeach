The beach is less than 1000 feet from the house and a short walk.

## Loungers and Table

There are two beach chairs in the bedroom closet for you to use. There is also a fold-out table in a black bag that you can take with you.

Please rinse the chairs and leave them outside until they are thoroughly dry before bringing them back inside.

## Cooler

There's a small soft-sided cooler in the pantry.

## Beach Towels

We provide towels specifcally for the beach and dogs. You can find beach towels in the basked on the floor in the bedroom. The dog towel has a paw print pattern. Do not take the bathroom towels to the beach or use them to get sand off you or your pets.

## Drinkware

Do not take glasses, dishes or cups from the kitchen cupboard to the beach. We provide drinkware specifically for outdoor use. They're metal and you can find them in the pantry.

## Post Beach Cleanup

Please use the faucet on the driveway side of the house to rinse sand off. **Do not rinse sand off in the bathtub or sink in the house.**

There is a small broom hanging on a hook next to the front door. Please use it to sweep sand off shoes. Place sandy shoes on the black plastic mat â€“ either the one inside the house, or on the porch.

## Getting To the Beach

Beach access is free, but the parking lot charges a fee that varies depending on days.

Walk down North Avenue and take a right on Cypress followed by a left on Bumble Bee Path to get to the beach.

Another route is Ocean View Avenune all the way to end and walking down the hill. We only recommend this route if you're comfortable climbing up and down steep sandstone rocks.
