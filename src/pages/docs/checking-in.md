# Checking In

The house has 2 entrances. Please use the one on Ocean View Avenue to enter and exit when you leave the house unattended. Please note, the storm door on the North Avenue (nearest the driveway) entrance is locked. So you will not be able to open it until you are inside the house.

The house has a smart lock. You should have received a notice from Airbnb with instructions to download the app, as well as a one-time key code to open it. The keypad is on the left side of the door. If you have not received anything from AirBnb about the lock, let me know as soon as possible, and I can issue you a code.

## Once inside

Please inspect the house and let us know within the first 2 hours of your arrival. If there are any issues, or concerns, you can notify our property manager Lesley. She lives in the area and should be able to address most issues. Also, you can contact her in case of an emergency.
