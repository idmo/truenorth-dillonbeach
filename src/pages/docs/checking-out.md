## Checkout Time

Checkout time is 11am on the last day of your reservation. If you need additional time, please contact us via the app.

The smart lock code changes at 11am so, you will not be able to re-enter the house with the code you were sent. Please let us know if you need additional time.

## Before you Leave

### Windows and Shades

Please close any open windows, and make sure all windows are locked. Close the curtains in the living room. The blinds in the bedroom, and the blinds in the kitchen.

Please remove the cushion from the bay window. Place it against the wall, under the front windows. Leave the curtains open for the Bay Window.

### Front Door

Please lock the storm door and latch the top half of the Dutch door to the bottom half and deadbolt it.

### Bedding and Towels

Please remove the sheets and pillow cases from the bed and put them on foot of the bed so the cleaning staff can launder them.

Leave the bathroom towels, and washclothes in the hamper next to the dresser.

If you used the beach towels or pet sheets make sure to shake as much sand out of them outside before bringing them in the house. Place them in the hamper as well.

### Lights and Appliances

Please makre sure light switches are turned to off. Make sure the stove and oven are off as well. Unplug the television, toaster, and coffeemaker.

### Water

Please make sure all faucets are off and the toilet isn't running.

### Garbage and Recycling

Please remove all garbage and recycling from the house and dispose of them in the outside receptacles. The receptacles are at 53 Ocean View Avenue. They're behind the fence next to the pink structure in the yard. We share the cans with that house.

### Dirty Dishes

The house does not have a dishwasher. Please wash the dishes you use and dry them in the rack in the sink. It's okay to leave clean dishes in the rack when you leave.
