Following are the things you need to do before checking out of the house and making your final exit.

---

## Checkout Time

Checkout time is 11am on the last day of your reservation. If you need additional time, please contact us via the app.

The smart lock code changes at 11am so, you will not be able to re-enter the house with the code you were sent. Please let us know if you need additional time.

## Before you Leave

### Bedding and Towels

Please remove the sheets and pillow cases from the bed and put them on foot of the bed so the cleaning staff can launder them.

Same thing for the bathroom towels, and washclothes. Just put them in a separate pile near the bedding.

If you used the beach towels or pet sheets, please put them in a separate pile. Also, make sure to shake as much sand out of them outside before bringing them in the house.

### Lights and Appliances

Please makre sure light switches are turned to off. Make sure the stove and oven are off as well. For small appliances like the toaster, blender, and coffeemaker, feel free to unplug them just to be sure.

### Water

Please make sure all faucets are off and the toilet isn't running. If the toilet continues to fill after a long time, longer than three minutes, and jiggling the handle doesn't stop it, let our house manager know.

### Garbage and Recycling

Please remove all garbage and recycling from the house and dispose of them in the outside receptacles. More on this at on the [Garbage and Recyling Page](/docs/garbage-and-recycling)
