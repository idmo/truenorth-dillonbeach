We have taken great care to furnish the house to be comfortable and stylish. Several furniture items in the house are older and antique and not easily replaced or repaired.

This isn't really a place for a party or wild time, so keep the following in mind if that's what you're really looking for.

## No Drinking Games on The Furniture

Please treat the house and furniture with respect. It's not a party house. Games like Beer Pong and Quarters are fun, we get it, but they're also messy and lead to damaged furniture.

## Indoor Furniture

Do not rearrange the furniture in the house. The sofa is extremely heavy and attempting to move it could cause injuries.

Do not take any of the chairs, stools cushions, pillows etc. outside whether it's to the beach or just the porch. Indoor furniture is to remain indoors no matter what.

The same goes for anything hanging on the walls. Do not take them down or rearrange them.

## Outdoor Furniture

The outdoor tables and chairs are to remain outside, and on the porch. Do not bring these items into the house for additional seating. Feel free to move the chairs and tables around on the porch, but do not remove them from the porch, and do not take them to the beach.

We provide two lounge chairs in the bedroom closet. You can take these to the beach.

## Space Heater

The space heater is to remain inside the house at all times. It can be moved to other spots within the house, but no where else. Please return it to its original spot in the living room before you leave.
