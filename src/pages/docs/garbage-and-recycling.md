Cleaning services are not available during your stay. Please do not let garbage overaccumulate during your visit. Empty the cans in the outside receptacles when they're full.

Please keep garbage and recyclable items separated using the designated receptacles in the house.

## Garbage

### Kitchen

The can for garbage is attached to the cabinet door under the sink. Please be sure to use a small white plastic garage bag (found above the fridge in the basket) in the can. There should be a new bag in the can when you arrive.

### Bathroom

There is a small white garbage can between the vanity and the bathtub. It uses the same garbage bags as the one in the kitchen.

Please dispose of foul smelling garbage in outside receptacles.

### Taking out the Garbage

The can for garbage is outside, on the Ocean View street side, behind the pink structure and fence. It has the number 21 written on top.

## Food Waste

There are green compostable bags above the fridge for food waste.

### Taking Out Food Waste

The green bin receptacle is in the driveway, or behind the house. It's a large dark green container. Use it only for food and plant based waste. Using it for garbage will prevent it from getting emptied by the trash pick up company.

## Reycycling

The can for recycling is under the kitchen window. Do not use it as a second or larger garbage can.

Follow the same rules you normally would in your home for recyclables. Things like the following can be recycled:

- Glass
- Metal
- Soda cans
- Paper

### Taking Out Recycling

The blue recycling bin is outside, on the Ocean View street side, behind the pink structure and fence. It's next to the garbage can. It should have the number 21 written on it.
