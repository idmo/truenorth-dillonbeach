# Garbage and Reycling

Please keep garbage and recyclable items separated using the designated receptacles.

## Garbage

The can for garbage is attached to the cabinet door under the sink. Please be sure to use a small white plastic garage bag (found above the fridge in the basket) in the can. There should be a new bag in the can when you arrive.

If you need to throw out something smelly, take it to the outside can in a bag.

### Taking out the Garbage

The can for garbage is outside, on the Ocean View street side, behind the pink structure and fence. It has the number 21 written on top.

## Food Waste

There are green compostable bags above the fridge for food waste.

### Taking Out Food Waste

The green bin receptacle is in the driveway. It's a large dark green container. Use it only for food and plant based waste. Using it for garbage will prevent it from getting emptied by the trash pick up company.

## Reycycling

The can for recycling is under the kitchen window. Do not use it as a second or larger garbage can.

Follow the same rules you normally would in your home for recyclables. Things like the following can be recycled:

- Glass
- Metal
- Soda cans
- Paper
