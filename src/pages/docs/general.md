The homes in the Dillon Beach are made from old-growth wood and very close together. The community is more vulnerable to fire hazards than most. You may see guests at other homes doing some of the following, but that doesn't necessarily mean they have the owner's permission to do so.

Anything that produces a flame or smoke is not allowed on the property.

## No Smoking or Candles on the Property

There is absolutely no smoking, no vaping, no candles allowed on the property whether it's inside the house or outside. No exceptions. Do not throw cigarette butts out in the house or leave them in the yard.

## No Grills or Firepits

We do not proivde a grill or a firepit, nor do we allow guests to bring and use their own. Again, this is a preventive measure due to the extreme fire risk with old woodmen structures.

There are free firepits available to use on the beach.

## Parties and Events and Other

There is a zero-tolerance policy for parties. Like AirBnb, we do not allow parties at the property. A party is considered prolonged gathering (1 hour or longer) of people other than the registered guests, regardless of noise level. Guests caught having a party will be immediately asked to vacate the property. Examples of what could be consider a "party", but not limited toâ€¦

- Filming or video shoots commercial or other
- Bachelor/Bachelorette parties
- Gender Reveal parties or anything that involves confetti, smoke, silly string etc.

> This house is just too small for that kind of thing, and the risk of property damage is too great.

We have a no events policy at the house. By event we mean, anything that involves additional people staying at the house for prolonged periods of time other than the registered guests at the time the reservation was made. You can not add guests to your reservation once the reservation has been accepted.

> For example, you cannot book the house for 2 guests then later have 2 friends come and stay with you after you arrive.

We are fine with guests having visitors during their stay. For example, if you want to have 2-3 friends over for dinner. Keep in mind, as the guest, **you are responsible for your visitor's behavior**. Any damage they do is your responsibility.

The visitors of the guest are not allowed to spend the night. Guest's visitors who spend the night are considered additional guests and will be charged an additional guest fee.

{% callout type="warning" title="Rule of Thumb" %}
Use of the house for anything other than lodging by 2 people and requires excessive cleaning and potential damage is not allowed.
