True North Dillon Beach is a very old house. It was built in 1928 and has had many modifications made since. We renovated the house in 2021, but tried to maintain as much of the older charm as possible.

Little old houses aren't for everyone, we get it, but if you love them like we do, then you'll hopefully love this place too.

With that in mind, here are some things to think about with the house.

---

## Doors

The front door is a dutch door. The top can be opened leaving the bottom closed. Do not forget to latch the top door to the bottom when locking. Otherwise, the bottom can be opened even when the top is deadbolted.

The house was built with old growth Redwood and Douglas Fir. Both woods can withstand the harsh ocean conditions. Unfortunately, the metal parts of the house do not. The storm doors may not operate as smoothly when it comes to opening and closing the screens.

### Locks

The front door has a regular deadbolt lock. It can only be locked from the inside of the house. We not provide a key for guests for this door. You will need to lock it from the insdide and use the side door to come and go.

The side door is your primary entrance and exit. It has a smart lock that can be opened with an app, or with the code on the keypad on the left.

{% callout type="warning" title="Do Not Get Locked Out!" %}
The smart lock on the side door automatically locks 2 minutes after the door is closed. So be sure you remember the code to get in.
{% /callout %}

## Games

We have provided a couple board games and decks of cards for our guests. You can find them on the bottom shelf near the side door.

Please only use these items in the house or on the porch.
