Parking is scarce in Dillon Beach, and having a private driveway will make coming going a lot easier.

---

You can park up to 2 cars lengthwise in the driveway, which is on the west side (North Ave) side of the house.

Please note, there isn't any street parking on Ocean View Avenue or North Avenue in front of the house. The streets are very narrow and we must maintain enough room for emergency vehicles.

People may try to park on the street in front of, or on the side of the house – especially on busy days. We provide pylons on the porch for you to put out, if you'd like to prevent this.

Feel free to tell people who try to park in those spots it's not allowed, for safety reasons. It might help to remind them it's a $500 ticket too.

## No EV Charging

The house does not have the capability or capacity to re-charge electric vehicles. Please do not attempt to do so during your visit. There are no outdoor outlets, and running extension cords from inside the house are not allowed either.

## Cars Only

The drive way is not long enought to accommodate a car and a trailer. So only cars (SUVs, pickups included) are allowed in the driveway.

## Additional Parking

If you bring an additional vehicle and it is too long for the driveway, you can park on Oceana drive two blocks east of the house.
