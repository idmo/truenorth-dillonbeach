Dillon Beach is known for being very dog-friendly. We love dogs and know how hard it is to find places that accommodate them. Please help us maintain our ability to allow dogs for future guests by following these simple rules.

---

## Dogs Only

We love all animals, but have to limit pets to dogs only due to allergies. Because the house is so small, we have to limit it to a single small or medium dog – 50 pounds or less as well.

## Inside Dog Rules

Do not let dogs in the house when they are wet or sandy. We provide towels specifically for your dog (paw print pattern). Please use them to thoroughly dry off your pal before letting them in the house.

### Leaving Pets Alone in the House

We have a dog of our own and realize that well-behaved dog at home, may act very differently in a strange place. Keep in mind your dog may smell our dog.

Dogs can be incredibly destructive when left alone. If you dog has separation issues and there's a chance they will get anxious being left alone for long periods of time, **do not leave them in the house unattended**.

Also, there are lots, and I mean lots, of dogs in Dillon Beach. People are always walking by with them. This may get your dog excited and they'll jump on furniture, or urinate in the house.

### Furniture

The cover on the sofa is to protect it from pets as well as people. It is to remain on the sofa regardless of whether or not you brought a pet.

We prefer guests keep their pets off the bed, but again, we have a dog. Please keep the dog sheet on the bed (paw print pattern) when people are not using the bed just in case.

### Window Seat and Cushion

The cushion on the window seat is custom and difficult to replace and clean. Under no conditions, are dogs allowed on it – even with a sheet.

If you leave your dog alone in the house, please remove the cushion and put it in the bedroom closet.

## On The Beach

This is the best part for dogs. Dillon Beach is possibly the biggest dog-friendly beach you or your pal will ever see. There is over 2 1/2 miles of beach stretching all the way down to Lawson Landing.

Dogs can be off-leash pretty much anywhere on the beach. However, you will need to abide by any signs that require your dog to be on-leash.

Please be sure to clean up after your dog on the beach. They do provide bags at the main beach entrance.

{% callout type="warning" title="Keep In Mind" %}
Most of the dogs on the beach will be off-leash, and friendly. However, there have been incidents of dogs getting attacked by other dogs. Proceed with caution. And if your dog is not good with other dogs, keep them on a leash and let others know. They tend to assume all dogs like each other.

## Around the Village

Most of the residents of Dillon Beach have dogs, and they're incredibly fond and tolerant of them. There are a couple that are not. If your dog is agressive, consider keeping them on-leash, even if they are friendly. If your dog is off-leash try to keep them out of the neighbor's yards.

Car traffic in Dillon Beach is minimal and slow, which is great for people and pets. However, always be careful when your dog is off-leash as some drivers do not always follow the speed limit or see stop signs.
