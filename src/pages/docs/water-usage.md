# Water Usage

Marin County, like the rest of California, is experiencing a severe drought. The water supply in Dillon Beach is very limted as we're not on the main sources as the rest of the county.

We ask that you do your part to conserve water by avoiding the following:

- Using the hose for things other than rinsing sand off yoru feet
- Running the shower or bath for more than 7 minutes
- Washing dishes one or two at a time

## Things that are prohibited

Following are things that cannot be done at all based on the county rules.

- Wash or rinsing vehicles
- Filling up wading pools or large containers of water

> In general please avoid running the water for long periods of time. It's not just a matter of significant cost, but we actually can run out of water.

## Septic System

Please note, we are not on a sewer system like you may be at home. The house is on a septic system which is way more restrictive in terms of what can go down the drains or toilet.

### What You Can Flush

The list of things you cannot flush is much longer than the things you can. So please follow this simple rule.

- Only Septic tank safe Toilet Paper (provided for you). It is made to dissolve whereas regular paper does not.

### Definitely Not to be Flushed!

- Kleenex or tissue
- Paper Towels
- Reglar toilet paper
- Feminine Hygeine products like tampons and pad
- Diapers
- Baby Wipes
- Food

{% callout type="warning" title="When in Doubt!" %}
Just throw it out. Avoid flushing anything but the septic tank safe toilet paper. Toilet backups require a call to the pump truck.
