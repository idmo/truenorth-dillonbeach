title: 'Water Usage'
description: 'Please do not waste water.'
---

Marin County, like the rest of California, is experiencing a severe drought. The water supply in Dillon Beach is trucked in, and very limted.

We ask that you do your part to conserve water by avoiding the following:

- Using the hose for things other than rinsing off sand
- Running the shower or bath for more than 7 minutes
- Washing dishes one or two at a time

---

## Things that are prohibited

Following are things that cannot be done at all based on the county rules.

- Wash or rinsing vehicles
- Filling up wading pools or large containers (more than 50 gallons) of water

{% callout type="warning" title="Rule of Thumb" %}
In general please avoid running the water for long periods of time. It's not just a matter of cost, but we actually can run out of water.
{% /callout %}

## Septic System

The house is on a septic system, not a sewer. This is way more restrictive in terms of what can be flushed or go down the drains.

### What You Can Flush

There are so many things you cannot flush in a septic system, it's just easier to list the one thing you canâ€¦

- Only **septic tank safe toilet paper** (provided). It is made to dissolve whereas regular paper does not.

### Definitely Not to be Flushed!

- Kleenex or tissue
- Paper Towels
- Reglar toilet paper
- Feminine Hygeine products like tampons and pads
- Diapers
- Baby Wipes
- Food

{% callout type="warning" title="When in Doubt!" %}
Just throw it out. Avoid flushing anything but the septic tank safe toilet paper. Toilet backups require a call to the pump truck.
{% /callout %}

There are additional rolls of septic safe toilet paper under the bathroom sink. We try to provide enough for your visit. If you do run out, you can purchase rolls at the general store.
