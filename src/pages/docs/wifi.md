We provide wireless broadband internet access at the house.

---

The house has high-speed WiFi. It's rated between 100-200mbps upload and download, fast enough for video conferencing and streaming HD videos.

It's more than fast enough to do any kind of work should you need to.

The WiFi at the house is very reliable. The router, in the bedroom closet, is on a battery backup. In case of power outages, you should still have Internet access for quite a while.

## Network Info

The WiFi network is named **21 North Dillon Beach** and the password is **UraWiFiJunkee** (case sensitive).

## Cellular / Mobile Service

Verizon has the best cellular coverage in Dillon Beach, and is the only one that works at the house. Other services like AT&T, T-Mobile etc. do not work at the house. However, you can catch a signal down in the beach parking lot if you really need to connect.

### Phone Service

The house does not have a landline. The only way to make phone calls is with your mobile phone. If you do not get a cell signal, turn on your phone's WiFi calling feature.
