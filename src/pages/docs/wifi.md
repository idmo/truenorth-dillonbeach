We provide wireless broadband internet access at the house.

The house has high-speed WiFi. It's rated between 100-200mbps upload and download, fast enough for video conferencing and streaming HD videos.

It's more than fast enough to do any kind of work should you need to.

The WiFi at the house is very reliable. The router, in the bedroom closet, is on a battery backup. In case of power outages, you should still have Internet access for quite a while.
